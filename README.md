# Deep Learning for ECG Signal Analysis
This demo shows how can we build a model using transfer learning techniques to classify signal data. Here we used Wavelet Transform to generate a time-frequency representation of a signal. The Wavelet Transform greatly enhances the spectral information present as a function of time in the signal and we can save this information as a Image.
## Step 1:
Explore the Signals.
## Step 2:
Generate Wavelet Time-Frequency Representations.
## Step 3:
Train a Pre-Trained Network (AlexNet).
## Step 4:
Evaluate the Trained Model.
