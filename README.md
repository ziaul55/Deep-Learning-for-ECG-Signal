# Deep Learning for ECG Signal Analysis
This demo shows how can we build a model using transfer learning techniques to classify signal data. We will use Wavelet Transform to generate a time-frequency representation of a signal.  The Wavelet Transform greatly enhances the spectral information present as a function of time in the signal and we can save this information as a Image.
## Steps:
### Explore the Signals.
### Generate Wavelet Time-Frequency Representations.
### Train a Pre-Trained Network (AlexNet).
### Evaluate the trained model.
